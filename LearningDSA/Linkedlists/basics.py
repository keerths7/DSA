# In linked lists, each node requires extra memory to store a pointer to the next node,  # which increases memory usage compared to arrays.  
# Linked lists allow dynamic resizing at runtime since their size is not fixed initially, unlike arrays that require predefined sizes or costly resizing operations.  
# In arrays, accessing the 5th element is efficient and done using indexing (arr[4]) in O(1) time.  
# However, in linked lists, elements are stored at arbitrary memory locations, requiring traversal from the head node, making element access O(n) in the worst case.

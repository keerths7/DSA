# Lists are built in data structure, that comes with the standard python library
# List is a data structure that holds an ordered collection of items
# Lists can contain different types of data, including a list in list itself (nested list)

# Time Complexity- O(n)     each element in the list is added, hence O(n)
# Space Complexity- O(n)
